This Python project is a basic restaurant order system that allows users to select items from a predefined menu and calculates the total amount due. The menu, which includes items like Pizza, Pasta, Burger, Salad, and Coffee with their respective prices, is first displayed along with a welcoming message. Users are then prompted to enter the names of the items they wish to order. If an item is available, its price is added to the total. Users can place multiple orders, and after each entry, they are asked if they want to add more items. The process continues until they choose not to add any more items. Finally, the system displays the total amount to be paid. The code has been improved by consolidating repetitive sections and correcting formatting errors for a more efficient and user-friendly experience.
